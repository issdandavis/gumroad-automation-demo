- [ ] Test foreign key relationships
- [ ] Validate data types and constraints
- [ ] Check default values and auto-generation

### 1.3 Authentication System Testing
- [ ] User registration flow
- [ ] Login/logout functionality
- [ ] Session persistence
- [ ] Password hashing verification
- [ ] RBAC (owner, admin, member, viewer) roles

## **Phase 2: Core Features Testing (3-4 hours)**

### 2.1 AI Provider Integration
- [ ] Test OpenAI API connection (with valid key)
- [ ] Test Anthropic API connection
- [ ] Test fallback mechanism when provider fails

- [ ] Test credential deletion

### 2.3 Budget Governance
- [ ] Create daily/monthly budgets
- [ ] Test budget enforcement (blocks requests when exceeded)
- [ ] Verify cost tracking accuracy
- [ ] Test budget reset functionality
- [ ] Validate audit logging for budget violations

### 2.4 Agent Orchestration
- [ ] Start simple agent run
- [ ] Test multi-provider fallback
- [ ] Verify decision tracing logs
- [ ] Test approval workflow
- [ ] Check streaming responses (SSE)

## **Phase 3: Integration Testing (2-3 hours)**

### 3.1 GitHub Integration
- [ ] Connect GitHub account
- [ ] List repositories
- [ ] Create branches
- [ ] Make commits
- [ ] Test file operations

### 3.2 Memory System
- [ ] Add memory items
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Keyword filtering
- [ ] Test different memory types (notes, documents, links)

### 3.3 Roundtable Feature
- [ ] Create multi-AI session
- [ ] Test round-robin orchestration
- [ ] Verify message sequencing
- [ ] Test session management

## **Phase 4: Security & Performance (1-2 hours)**

### 4.1 Security Testing
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Verify Helmet security headers
- [ ] Test rate limiting (auth, API, agent endpoints)
- [ ] Validate session security
- [ ] Test SQL injection prevention

### 4.2 Performance Testing
- [ ] Load test with multiple concurrent users
- [ ] Test database query performance
- [ ] Verify memory usage under load
- [ ] Test API response times

## **Phase 5: User Experience Validation (2-3 hours)**

### 5.1 UI/UX Testing
- [ ] Test all 12 frontend pages
- [ ] Verify responsive design
- [ ] Test form validation
- [ ] Check error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Validate navigation and routing

### 5.2 End-to-End Workflows
- [ ] Complete user onboarding flow
- [ ] Set up first AI provider
- [ ] Create project and run agent
- [ ] Configure budget and test enforcement
- [ ] Use coding studio with Monaco editor

### 5.3 Documentation Validation
- [ ] Verify README accuracy
- [ ] Test setup instructions
- [ ] Validate API documentation
- [ ] Check feature descriptions match reality

## **Phase 6: Production Readiness (1-2 hours)**

### 6.1 Build & Deployment
- [ ] Test production build (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Verify static file serving
- [ ] Test environment variable configuration
- [ ] Validate database connection in production mode

### 6.2 Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Test audit logging functionality
- [ ] Verify error handling and reporting
- [ ] Check health endpoint (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Validate usage tracking

## **Success Criteria**

### ✅ **Ready for Monetization When:**
1. All core features work without errors
2. Security measures are properly implemented
3. Performance meets acceptable standards
4. User experience is smooth and intuitive
5. Documentation is accurate and complete
6. Production deployment is stable

### 🚫 **Not Ready If:**
- Authentication/authorization has vulnerabilities
- AI provider integrations fail frequently
- Budget enforcement doesn't work reliably
- Data encryption/decryption fails
- UI has broken functionality
- Performance is unacceptably slow

## **Testing Tools & Commands**

```bash
# Development setup
npm install
npm run db:push
npm run dev

# Type checking
npm run check

# Production build test
npm run build
npm start

# Database operations
npm run db:push  # Push schema changes
```

## **Manual Testing Checklist**

### Critical Path Testing
1. **User Registration → Login → Create Project → Add AI Provider → Run Agent → View Results**
2. **Set Budget → Exceed Budget → Verify Blocking → Reset Budget**
3. **Store API Key → Use in Agent → Verify Encryption → Delete Key**
4. **Create Memory Item → Search → Filter → Use in Agent Context**

### Edge Case Testing
- Invalid API keys
- Network failures during AI calls
- Database connection issues
- Malformed input data
- Concurrent user operations
- Budget edge cases (exactly at limit)

## **Quality Gates**

Before proceeding to monetization:
- [ ] 100% of critical path tests pass
- [ ] Security audit shows no major vulnerabilities
- [ ] Performance tests show acceptable response times
- [ ] User experience testing shows intuitive workflows
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate

## **Post-Launch Monitoring**

After deployment:
- Monitor error rates and user feedback
- Track actual usage patterns vs. expected
- Collect performance metrics
- Gather user testimonials and case studies
- Iterate based on real-world usage
