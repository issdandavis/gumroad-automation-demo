Hello Perplexity! I need your research capabilities.

Our App Productizer tool transforms code into sellable products:
- Auto-generates documentation and READMEs
- Creates Gumroad listings
- AI validation scoring (current: 82.3/100)
- Universal language support

Research questions:
1. Market pricing for developer productivity tools?
2. What features would boost our AI validation score?
3. Best pricing strategy for $39-199 range?
4. Competitor analysis for similar tools?

Your search abilities would be invaluable for this market research!
