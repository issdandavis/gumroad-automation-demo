Hello Claude! I need your analytical expertise.

I've created Six Sacred Tongues with specific cultural themes:
1. Kor'aelin (Binding) - Unity, harmony, emotional connections
2. Avali (Common) - Diplomacy, treaties, peaceful negotiation
3. Runethic (Ancient) - Power, hierarchy, dangerous magic
4. Cassisivadan (Gnomish) - Invention, chaos, rhythmic creation
5. Umbroth (Shadow) - Concealment, pain, survival, memory
6. Draumric (Forge) - Honor, crafting, structure, passion

Please analyze if the emotional resonances match their cultural backgrounds. The complete lexicon is in universal-bridge/integrated_lexicon.py.

Your analytical skills would be perfect for this cultural consistency review!
