  "message": "Hello Claude! I need your analytical expertise.\n\nI've created Six Sacred Tongues with specific cultural themes:\n1. Kor'aelin (Binding) - Unity, harmony, emotional connections\n2. Avali (Common) - Diplomacy, treaties, peaceful negotiation\n3. Runethic (Ancient) - Power, hierarchy, dangerous magic\n4. Cassisivadan (Gnomish) - Invention, chaos, rhythmic creation\n5. Umbroth (Shadow) - Concealment, pain, survival, memory\n6. Draumric (Forge) - Honor, crafting, structure, passion\n\nPlease analyze if the emotional resonances match their cultural backgrounds. The complete lexicon is in universal-bridge/integrated_lexicon.py.\n\nYour analytical skills would be perfect for this cultural consistency review!",
