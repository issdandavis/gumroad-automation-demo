## 🔧 API Reference

### Core Framework API
```python
from self_evolving_core import EvolvingAIFramework

# Initialize framework
framework = EvolvingAIFramework()
framework.initialize()

# Get system status
status = framework.get_status()
print(f"Generation: {status['generation']}")
print(f"Fitness: {status['fitness_score']}")

# Propose mutation
mutation = Mutation(
    type="intelligence_upgrade",
    description="Improve response accuracy",
    fitness_impact=5.0
)
result = framework.propose_mutation(mutation)

# Monitor fitness
fitness = framework.get_fitness()
print(f"Success Rate: {fitness.success_rate}")
print(f"Cost Efficiency: {fitness.cost_efficiency}")
```

### REST API Endpoints
